# Java-Fun

I'm totally aware this code actually sucks and is incredibly unefficient, however I thought that maybe someone would like the concept itself or the ways I managed to handle some problems.

Also, it had been written before I even learned the point of creating classes, so I had been using them only as some kind of 'divisor' to different-purpose functions, which almost all are therefore made static.

Anyway, creating this code provided me countless hours of reinventing different ways to solve problems, that were currently showing up.
Personally, I considered it just as a clear entertainment, that sometimes was turning into anger and iritation, when several hours in a row had given no progress.


Feel free to test it!








I'm fully aware about the bugs while using root on the calc app - it's use is only some kind of simple-calc-like.
The programm ingores numbers after root, so method of use looks like ->>>> 4 root = , and this will provide proper result


Once I find some time, I guess I'm gonna rewrite the code, fix the bugs with root, improve displayment, and make the entirety more efficient.
