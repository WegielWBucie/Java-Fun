I'm fully aware about the bugs while using root on the calc app - it's use is only some kind of simple-calc-like.
The programm ingores numbers after root, so method of use looks like ->>>> 4 root = , and this will provide proper result


Once I find some time, I guess I'm gonna rewrite the code, fix the bugs with root, improve displayment, and make the entirety more efficient.
